Question : 
2.3 Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using input to compute gross pay. Use 35 hours and a rate of 2.75 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 96.25). You should use input to read a string and float() to convert the string to a number. Do not worry about error checking or bad user data
ans:
hrs = input("Enter Hours:")
hours = float(hrs)

# Prompt the user for rate per hour
rate_per_hour = float(input("Enter rate per hour: "))

# Calculate gross pay
gross_pay = hours * rate_per_hour


print("Pay:",gross_pay)
